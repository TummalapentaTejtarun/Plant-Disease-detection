## Introduction

This project involves building and evaluating multiple deep learning models for image classification. The goal is to compare different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and assess their performance on a given dataset. We aim to identify the best-performing model and provide insights into its performance metrics.

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

## Usage

#Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a specified directory using TensorFlow's tf.data API. It consists of images categorized into different classes.

#Exploring the Dataset
Initial exploration includes checking the dataset's structure, class distribution, and basic statistics. Visualization of sample images helps understand the data better.

#Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets to ensure proper model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

#Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization. This helps in making the model more robust and accurate.

#Model Building
#Custom CNN Model
Architecture: The custom CNN consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and ends with dense layers for classification.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.

#ResNet50V2 Model
Architecture: ResNet50V2 is a pre-trained deep residual network with 50 layers, optimized for image classification tasks.
Compilation: It is compiled with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.

#MobileNetV2 Model
Architecture: MobileNetV2 is a lightweight, efficient model designed for mobile and edge devices, featuring depthwise separable convolutions.
Compilation: It is compiled with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.

#InceptionV3 Model
Architecture: InceptionV3 includes multiple inception blocks with various convolutional filters to capture different features.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.

#Ensemble Model
Architecture: The ensemble model combines predictions from the custom CNN, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 models to improve overall performance.
Compilation: The ensemble model is compiled using a weighted average of predictions from the individual models.

#Training and Evaluation
Training Models
Each model is trained for a specified number of epochs with a learning rate schedule. Hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate are tuned to achieve optimal performance.

#Plotting Training and Validation Metrics
Training and validation metrics, including accuracy and loss, are plotted using Matplotlib to visualize model performance over epochs.

#Evaluating Model Performance
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to analyze the results.

#Model Testing
Predicting with Trained Models
The trained models are used to make predictions on the test dataset. Predictions are compared to ground truth labels to assess model performance.

#Displaying Results and Predictions
Results are displayed using visualization tools to show sample predictions alongside ground truth labels. This helps in qualitatively assessing the models' performance
